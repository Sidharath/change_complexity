All measures are calculated at a particular commit (aka a version)

cmetrics (don't have this table, but could get it if necessary): cmetrics for each file
cmetrics_sum: sum of all the cmetrics for that version so sum(LOC) = sum of all the lines of code in each file (or the size of the system in LOC)
cmetrics_change: sum of all the cmetrics for that version, but only on files that changed
cmetrics_dif: the difference between the two versions for each cmetric sum(LOC) at V2 - sum(LOC) at V1 (not it's based on cmetrics_sum) 

change_complexity: change measures at each commit
change_complexity_decay_1000: sum of change measure for the last 1000 commits
